    <h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
    <p class="first">
        JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.The programs in this language are called scripts.
        They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
        Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.In
        this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.
    </p>

        Summary
    </h2>
    <p class="second">
        JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language, but it is now used in many other environments as
        well.
        Today, JavaScript has a unique position as the most widely-adopted browser language with full integration in
        HTML/CSS.
        There are many languages that get “transpiled” to JavaScript and provide certain features. It is recommended to
        take a look at them, at least briefly, after mastering JavaScript.
